							<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							I've successfully completed year 12, taking the VCE Pathway. <br />
							My subjects in year 12 were: Linguistics, Further, Informatics, Business Management and Vocational (VET IT). <br />
							Upon completion of year 12 exam and after 3 months of anxiously waiting, I've now been accepted into my first preference.<br> <br />
							I've also come to believe that you can never stop learning, no matter your age. <br> </br>
							“The world is a university and everyone in it is a teacher. Make sure when you wake up in the morning, you go to school.” ―T. D. Jakes
							adaptation. <br> </br>
							I'm a Vietnamese Australian who was born in New Zealand, I later moved to Melbourne at the age of 3 and have been here ever since. <br> </br>
							Melbourne is a wonderful place to be with so many opportunities at hand for success. <br> </br>
							One of my favourite things to do in my spare time is to constantly explore & research to find out about new upcomming technolgies such as autonomous cars or upcomming smartphone technologies on the subreddit. <br> </br>
							After my 3 years of study here, I would expect to have a better understanding of what my intentions are in the field of I.T, what I would love to become and what I would love to accomplish with the sets of skills I've learnt during this
							course.<br> </br>

						<h3>Why Information Technology?</h3>
						<p> I'm a full time RMIT student studying a three year Bachelors degree for Information Technology. <br> <br />
							I find this course very intersting, as there is a need for technology to rapidly develop in growth. The consumers themselves will need to do the same. <br> <br />
							Therefore, it is fundamental that people like us ensure consumers have a good time with adaption.
						</p>

						<h3>Making The World a Better Place</h3>
						<p>Technology in the upcomming future certainly sheds light, providing benefits making our lives easier.<br> </br>
							Such as allowing a business/organization to effectively meet their customer needs. <br> </br>
							While also allow companies with the most innovative technolgies to dominate the markets, thus changing the industry structure/rules for competition to outperform comptetition. <br> </br>

						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="icon major style5 fa-diamond"></span>
						<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
						<p>I chose RMIT as my first preference thanks to it's location, as this plays an important role in uniting the heart of Melbourne and it's people. Making for a truly unique lifestyle.
							While also for convenience sake in regards to travel time benefitting most students and tutors as the prime location of the city campus means less than a 5 minute walk from the popular Melbourne Central, making commuting much more
							appealing. <br> </br>

					<h1>Creating a Game via Unity</h1> <br></br>

					<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
					<p>Ideally, I would love to express my inner interest of creativity, by creating a game with the Unity Engine. This game will be a basic 2D game, with some basic graphics. I may have little experience in game making but however would still
						love to learn/do something new and completely different from what I'm used to. Additionally, learning C++ in the progress as it may become useful sometime later in my I.T career when it comes to developing further expertise with
						programming languages.<br></br>
					</p>

					<h2><b>Motivation</b></h2>
					<p>There are three factors Unity provides that contributes towards motivating me to create a game as my first project:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Unity's platform support is highly compatible, extended up to 27 platforms. The application developed can therefore be ran
							from PC's to Mobile devices providing for a robust and flexible experience. </li><br></br>

						<li>A text editor (provided by IDE) is provided in the Unity application to write the code. The IDE is also capable of support JavaScript as well as C# for scripting which are pretty important for the development of games.</li><br></br>

						<li>Debugging is made much more easier with Unity, as all the game variables are displayed during gameplay, which allows the developers to debug the process in realtime.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Thanks to these three pros, I think approaching game development for the first time would make my overall experience less intimidating and much more fun and interesting!</p>

					<h1>Creating a Game via Unity</h1> <br></br>

					<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
					<p>Ideally, I would love to express my inner interest of creativity, by creating a game with the Unity Engine. This game will be a basic 2D game, with some basic graphics. I may have little experience in game making but however would still
						love to learn/do something new and completely different from what I'm used to. Additionally, learning C++ in the progress as it may become useful sometime later in my I.T career when it comes to developing further expertise with
						programming languages.<br></br>
					</p>

					<h2><b>Motivation</b></h2>
					<p>There are three factors Unity provides that contributes towards motivating me to create a game as my first project:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Unity's platform support is highly compatible, extended up to 27 platforms. The application developed can therefore be ran
							from PC's to Mobile devices providing for a robust and flexible experience. </li><br></br>

						<li>A text editor (provided by IDE) is provided in the Unity application to write the code. The IDE is also capable of support JavaScript as well as C# for scripting which are pretty important for the development of games.</li><br></br>

						<li>Debugging is made much more easier with Unity, as all the game variables are displayed during gameplay, which allows the developers to debug the process in realtime.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Thanks to these three pros, I think approaching game development for the first time would make my overall experience less intimidating and much more fun and interesting!</p>

					<h2><b>Description</b></h2>
					<p>Although not much of a product nor service, the project idea of creating a game will alow me to furthermore develop expertise in a new field for myself only. This project will give me an insight into the field of game development in
						which I may really enjoy and consider becoming much more serious with developing games altogether.</p>
						
					<p>As I may not have much prior experience in writing C++ or C# scripting, there are alternatives such as downloading free assests in the Unity store to use in my game. This way I won't need to learn a whole programming language.
						Additionally, importing a Unity packages allows me as a new user to better familiarize myself with the Unity application much more quicklier as I wouldn't need to bother creating my own sprites which would take up a majority of time in
						this project. The convenience of having packages results in me having more fun experimenting with level design compared to drawing/programming animations/scripts/sprites etc.</p>

					<p>In terms of the genre of my game, I would love to create a 2D style platform level game which includes a rewards system to players with progression. Progression should become challenging and difficult to overcome various obstacles
						present in the game to ensure it doesn't become too stale. The more the user progresses, the higher the octane and reward for bypassing that level.</p><br></br>

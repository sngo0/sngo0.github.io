					<h1>Creating a Game via Unity</h1> <br></br>

					<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
					<p>Ideally, I would love to express my inner interest of creativity, by creating a game with the Unity Engine. This game will be a basic 2D game, with some basic graphics. I may have little experience in game making but however would still
						love to learn/do something new and completely different from what I'm used to. Additionally, learning C++ in the progress as it may become useful sometime later in my I.T career when it comes to developing further expertise with
						programming languages.<br></br>
					</p>

					<h2><b>Motivation</b></h2>
					<p>There are three factors Unity provides that contributes towards motivating me to create a game as my first project:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Unity's platform support is highly compatible, extended up to 27 platforms. The application developed can therefore be ran
							from PC's to Mobile devices providing for a robust and flexible experience. </li><br></br>

						<li>A text editor (provided by IDE) is provided in the Unity application to write the code. The IDE is also capable of support JavaScript as well as C# for scripting which are pretty important for the development of games.</li><br></br>

						<li>Debugging is made much more easier with Unity, as all the game variables are displayed during gameplay, which allows the developers to debug the process in realtime.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Thanks to these three pros, I think approaching game development for the first time would make my overall experience less intimidating and much more fun and interesting!</p><b></br>

						<h2><b>Description</b></h2>
						<p>Although not much of a product nor service, the project idea of creating a game will alow me to furthermore develop expertise in a new field for myself only. This project will give me an insight into the field of game development in
							which I may really enjoy and consider becoming much more serious with developing games altogether.</p>

						<p>As I may not have much prior experience in writing C++ or C# scripting, there are alternatives such as downloading free assests in the Unity store to use in my game. This way I won't need to learn a whole programming language.
							Additionally, importing a Unity packages allows me as a new user to better familiarize myself with the Unity application much more quicklier as I wouldn't need to bother creating my own sprites which would take up a majority of time in
							this project. The convenience of having packages results in me having more fun experimenting with level design compared to drawing/programming animations/scripts/sprites etc.</p>

						<p>In terms of the genre of my game, I would love to create a 2D style platform level game which includes a rewards system to players with progression. Progression should become challenging and difficult to overcome various obstacles
							present in the game to ensure it doesn't become too stale. The more the user progresses, the higher the octane and reward for bypassing that level. I would also consider not incorporating penalites as to keep the game enjoyable and
							stress
							free as arcade style games like these usually are fun, quick and easy to play to pass the time or to clear the mind not furthermore cause havoc!</p><br></br>

						<h2><b>Tools and Technologies</b></h2><br></br>
						<ul>
							<h3><b>For Development:</b></h3>
							</p>
							<li><b>Software:</b> Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only & macOS 10.11+ </li><br></br>
							<li><b>Hardware:</b> <b>CPU:</b> SSE2 instruction set support <b>|</b> <b>GPU:</b> Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities</li><br></br>
							<li><b>Additional Platform Development Requirements:</b> <b>iOS:</b> Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.0 or higher <b>|</b> <b>Android:</b> Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend
								requires
								Android NDK
								<b>|</b> <b>Universal Windows Platform:</b> Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK </li><br></br>
						</ul>

						<ul>
							<h3><b>For Running Unity games:</b></h3>
							<li><b>Software:</b> <b>OS:</b> Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.11+, Ubuntu 12.04+, SteamOS+ </li><br></br>
							<li><b>Hardware:</b> <b>CPU:</b> SSE2 instruction set support <b>|</b> <b>GPU</b> Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities </li><br></br>
							<li><b>Addtional Platform Requirements for Running Unity Games:</b> iOS player requires iOS 9.0 or higher <b>|</b> Android: OS 4.1 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support or Atom CPU; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later <b>|</b> WebGL: Any recent
								desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari <b>|</b> Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 and a graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities</li><br></br>
						</ul>

						<h2><b>Skills Required</b></h2>
						<p>Using Unity to develop a basic game won't require much technical expertise. Expertises such as having a background knowledge in a the programming languages C++ or C# to develop sophisticated games. In my case however, I wouldn't be
							needing have a deep understanding of any major programming concepts as the game I am intending to create will use premade assests and sprites in the Unity Store, thus no developing is required making this project alot more fun and
							intuitive.</p>
						<p>A creative mindset is fundamental in creating a great game of all kinds of user groups such as age. Satisfying all ages may be difficult hence keeping the game simple, easy and fun to play without any punishments/penalties will keep
							everyone happy while the game fulfils the purposes of entertaining instead of creating more of a burden.</p>

				<h2>Why This Job?</h2>
				<p>I find this position particularly appealing to me as this company mentions of providing an interesting working environment with salary packaging and staff benefits. <br> </br>
					While the location (Richmond) is in close proximity of the CBD/public transport allowing for an easier commute.</p>
				<p>This full-time position sparks my interests as it gives me the responsibilities to provide support to staff and clinicians within the Epworth Clinic.
					Therefore, the role I have would benefit the clients/people in need of help such as influencing the efficiency of operations within Epworth's informatics.</p>
				<h2>Skills & Qualifications Required?</h2>
				<p>In order to be a succesful candidate, Epworth requires me to fulfill three main requirements:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Have a drivers license</li>
					<li> Have experience working in a diverse desktop environment</li>
					<li> Able to adjust to new technologies as they become industry innovations</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Why This Job?</h2>
				<p>I find this position particularly appealing to me as this company mentions of providing an interesting working environment with salary packaging and staff benefits. <br> </br>
					While the location (Richmond) is in close proximity of the CBD/public transport allowing for an easier commute.</p>
				<p>This full-time position sparks my interests as it gives me the responsibilities to provide support to staff and clinicians within the Epworth Clinic.
					Therefore, the role I have would benefit the clients/people in need of help such as influencing the efficiency of operations within Epworth's informatics.</p>
				<h2>Skills & Qualifications Required?</h2>
				<p>In order to be a succesful candidate, Epworth requires me to fulfill three main requirements:</p>
				<ol>
					<li> Have a drivers license</li>
					<li> Have experience working in a diverse desktop environment</li>
					<li> Able to adjust to new technologies as they become industry innovations</li>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<h2>Plan to Obtain Required Skills</h2>
				<p>Epworth requires these three essential skills for a successful candidate, thus I would need to obtain these skills in various ways.</p>
				<ol>
					<li> <b>Obtaining a drivers license:</b></li>
					This is a works in progress, and is achievable as I'm currently logging hours for my Probationary License test. <br> </br>
					<li> <b>Have experience working in a diverse desktop environment:</b> </li>
					In order to gain more experience in this field. I would need to familiarise myself as well as have an indepth knowledge with concurrent technologies i.e. Cloud Computing or the fundamentals of User Centred Design. <br> </br>
					<li> <b> Able to adjust to new technologies as they become industry innovations</b> </li>
					Like mentioned above, adaptation towards upcomming technology is of utmost importance. This is to ensure the business/organization itself keeps up with concurrent technology while avoiding falling behind its competitors.
					In Epworth's case, the clinic could benefit in having a much more efficient information systems infrastructure with state of the art technology thus providing their patients with the best possible care. 
				</ol>
